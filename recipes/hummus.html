        <p>An easy, budget-friendly version which won't have you missing out; silky smooth. <br> Here is what you'll need and how to make them:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>400g can chickpeas, drained (liquid reserved)</li>
            <li>1/2 garlic clove, crushed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Tip the chickpeas, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil into a small blender or food processor. Season and add the reserved liquid from the can of chickpeas.</li>
            <li>Blitz together until smooth, adding more of the reserved chickpea liquid to make a smoother hummus, if you like. Tip the hummus into a bowl, drizzle with more olive oil and chill until ready to serve.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Serve with pittas or vegetable crudit√©s. <br>
