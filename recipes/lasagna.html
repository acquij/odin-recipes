        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            <li>1 package of whole milk ricotta</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>a whole lot of shredded mozzarella and parmesan</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9×13 baking dish or coat with nonstick spray.</li>
            <li>In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook lasagna noodles according to package instructions.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add ground beef and onion and cook until beef has browned, about 3-5 minutes, making sure to crumble the beef as it cooks; season with salt and pepper, to taste. Drain excess fat. Stir in tomatoes and Italian seasoning until well combined.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, combine ricotta, 1/2 cup mozzarella and egg; set aside.</li>
            <li>Spread 1 cup tomato mixture onto the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish; top with 3 lasagna noodles, 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup mozzarella cheese. Repeat with a second layer. Top with remaining noodles, tomato mixture, 1 cup mozzarella cheese and Parmesan.</li>
            <li>Place into oven and bake for 35-45 minutes, or until bubbling. Then broil for 2-3 minutes, or until top is browned in spots.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Let cool if you can resist or dig in and burn your mouth beyond repair.</p>

        <p>On a rather arbitrary ranking of The Most Famous Foods Around The World Lasagna just missed out on a spot in the top ten:</p>
        <ol start="9">
            <li>Chinese Dim Sum</li>
            <li>Spaghetti</li>
            <li>Lasagna</li>
            <li>Bolognese</li>
            <li>Baba Ganoush</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Pizza claimed the number one spot, fair enough. You can see the whole ranking on <a href="https://www.worldtravelconnector.com/famous-foods-around-the-world/">World Travel Connector</a>.</p>
