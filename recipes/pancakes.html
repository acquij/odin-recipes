        <p>Start your day off right with these fluffy buttermilk pancakes, either on their own, with some fruit or maple syrup. <br> Here is what you'll need and how to make them:</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 tablespoons sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>3/4 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Sift together the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl sift together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Make sure there are no clumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the wet ingredients: In a small bowl, whisk the egg until the yolk and the white are combined. Add the buttermilk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk until combined.</li>
            <li>Make the pancake batter: Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and gently stir until just combined. If adding berries or chocolate, add them when the batter is not quite fully mixed. Continue mixing just until combined. Donâ€™t over mix, or your pancakes will be rubbery not light and fluffy</li>
            <li>Heat the skillet: Set a large, flat-bottomed non-stick or well-seasoned cast iron skillet over medium heat. Add the butter. Once the butter has melted and sizzles on the pan, scoop a rounded 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan. Add additional scoops to cook more pancakes, spaced a few inches apart.                Cook until you see bubbles forming in the center of the pancakes, and the edges look slightly drier than the middle, about 3 minutes. Flip and cook for about 2 minutes on the other side. The cakes should be lightly golden on both sides with crispy edges.</li>
            <li>Serve fresh off the griddle: Serve with maple syrup or powdered sugar and fruit. If feeding a crowd, keep warm on a plate in a low oven until ready to serve.</li>
